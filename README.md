# Automated Waveshaper
<br /> Able to load filter with different frequency filters and attenuation values
<br /> Configure frequency filters with fixed size granularity setting low and high frequency
<br />-Randomly select from list of different available frequency filter and attenuation size on each given
     time
<br />-Apply the selected attenuation size/frequency filter to wave-shaper device on each give time
<br />-Sample given frequency filters [26, 32, 46 Ghz wide frequency] and attenuation values [1,3,6,9,12,18 ,21 dB]
